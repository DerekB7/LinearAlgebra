Suppose $p$ which is irreducible over $\\mathbb F$, when viewed over $\\mathbb C$ has a double root -- this would tell us that resultant involving $p$ and $p'$ has zero determinant, but if we change to the subfield $\\mathbb F$ then the determinant of the Sylvester matrix (i.e. the resultant) does not change so $p$ has a common factor with $p'$ in $\\mathbb F$ which contradicts the irreducibility of $p$ in $\\mathbb F$.   \n",
