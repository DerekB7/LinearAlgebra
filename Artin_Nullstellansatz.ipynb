    "The idea behind this is \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.)** prove the Weak Nullstellansatz which is a special case of the Strong Nullstellansatz but the Weak Nullstellansatz implies this 'more general' case via some basic ideas about radical ideals and the Rabinowitsch trick (essentially by padding with an extra 'free variable').  The mechanics of the Rabinowitsch trick are not complicated, though the proof relies on some ideas with radical ideals and ultimately is outside the scope of this writeup.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**2.)** The Weak Nullstellansatz is given for $\\mathbb F\\big[x_1, x_2,..., x_{n-1},x_n\\big]$ for some algebraic closed field $\\mathbb F$.  As noted in 'Artin_chp11.ipynb', a corollary of *ex 11.1.9* is that an algebraically closed field cannot have finite cardinality -- that is $\\mathbb F$ must be an (at least countably) infinite field. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3.)** The $n=1$ case is immediate since we know $\\mathbb F\\big[x_1\\big]$ is a Principal Ideal Domain (recall e.g. prop 2.20 and corollary 2.21 on page 398 of Artin).  Since $\\mathbb F$ is algebraically closed, all nonconstant polynomials split into linear factors, so for any proper ideal $I$ there is some $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb F$ such that the entire ideal evaluates to zero under the substitution homomorphism. For avoidance of doubt since $\\mathbb F$ is a field, any non-zero element in $\\mathbb F$ is a unit, so any ideal not involving $x_1$ is the unit ideal (except of course for the zero element which generates the zero ideal and the desired result trivially holds).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**4.)** This sets up an induction on $n$.   and at the inductive step we have a substitution homomorphism.  We toggle the isomorphism  $\\mathbb F\\big[x_1, x_2,..., x_{n-1},x_n\\big]\\cong  R\\big[x_n\\big]$   \n",
    "where $R:=\\mathbb F\\big[x_1, x_2,..., x_{n-1}\\big]$ and by inductive hypothesis we know for *any* proper ideal $I' \\in R$ there is a a set of values $\\big[c_1, c_2,...,c_{n-1}\\big] \\in \\mathbb F^{n-1}$ where we may use a substitution homomorphism so $\\phi\\big(I'\\big) = \\{0\\}$ (i.e. $I'$ is in the kernel of this homomorphism).  Note that the subset of $I$ where $x_n$ has degree zero / isn't involved / is quotiented out may be called $I'$ which is not an ideal in $R\\big[x_n\\big]$, it *is* a proper ideal in $R$ (in particular it doesn't contain 1 so it is proper).  We may consider $I' := R \\cap I$.  \n",
    "\n",

    "note that if $f \\in I$ *and* $f\\in I'$ then it is *already* in the kernel of this homomorphism. There is a bit more work needed to deal with the case of $f\\in I$ but  $f \\notin I'$.      \n",
    "\n",
    "**5.)** If we consider elements of the form $\\gamma x_n^k$  for $\\gamma \\in \\mathbb F$ it is immediate that this ring homomorphism is surjective.  Since image of a surjective homomorphism of an ideal is an ideal we have  $\\Phi\\big(I\\big)$ is an ideal in $\\mathbb F\\big[x_n\\big]$.  So if $\\Phi\\big(I\\big)$ is a *proper* ideal, then we reuse our base case and we are done.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**6.)** To show this we are argue by contradiction.  Suppose $\\Phi\\big(I\\big)$ isn't a proper ideal -- i.e. suppose it is the unit ideal, so there is some $g\\in I$ where $\\Phi\\big(g\\big) = 1$.  We want to compare this against some other 'nice' polynomial $f\\in I$. In particular we may assume WLOG that $f$ is monic in $x_n$  (justified later via normalization).     \n",
    "\n",
    "**7.)** A classical way of comparing two polynomials is via placing their coefficients in $R$ in a Sylvester Matrix. The determinant of the Sylvester Matrix is called the Resultant $=\\text{Res}\\big(f,g,x_n\\big) $ (ref notes in 'Artin_chp11.ipynb').  A determinant is a polynomial in the entries in the Sylvester Matrix so it is immediate that $=\\text{Res}\\big(f,g,x_n\\big)\\in R $.  With some work (shown in 'Artin_chp11.ipynb') we have  \n",
    "$\\text{Res}\\big(f,g,x_n\\big)\\in I \\implies \\text{Res}\\big(f,g,x_n\\big)\\in \\big(I\\cap R\\big) \\implies \\text{Res}\\big(f,g,x_n\\big)\\in I'$  \n",
    "\n",
    "**8.)**  Since $\\text{Res}\\big(f,g,x_n\\big)\\in I'$ and $I'$ is a proper ideal, we know $\\text{Res}\\big(f,g,x_n\\big)\\neq 1$.  Yet a closer look at the Sylvester Matrix reveals a triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal, hence $\\text{Res}\\big(f,g,x_n\\big) =1$, a contradiction.  Thus $g \\notin I$ and we know $\\Phi\\big(I\\big)$ is a proper ideal which completes the proof.  \n",
