    "The key step in generalizing from positive matrices, which necessarily have a connected graph, to real non-negative matrices that the moderately more general Perron-Frobenius theory covers, is to confirm whether the real non-negative matrix has one communicating class (/ a connected graph).  If not then the graph is reducible into at least 2 smaller graphs (and we recursively drill down to individual collections of communicating classes, with some special care for analyzing transient states).  The key result, however, is to focus on graph connectivity.  So for our n by n matrices, a connected graph by definition means that each state is reachable from any other state in a finite number of steps, and e.g. by Cayley Hamilton this implies that they are reachable in at most $n$ steps.  So if we look at the Cesaro sum / ensemble average of our real non-negative matrix $\\mathbf A$ associated with a connected graph, then *that* is a positie matrix, i.e.  \n",
