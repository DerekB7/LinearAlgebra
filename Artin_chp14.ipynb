    "Since they both deal with finite sets, the fact that we average (over the $n!$ 'orbits' we sum over, working over characteristic zero) by dividing by $n!$ is really incidental.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In some sense the symmetrization technique in 14.Misc.7 is to apply $e_1$, the first elementary symmetric function (i.e. pure sum), to our total 'orbits' whereas in 14.Misc.10 we are applying $e_d$, the dth elementary symmetric function (i.e. a pure product) to our total 'orbits' (i.e. all roots of h in the splitting field).  \n",

    "This suggests that when dealing with finite sets the elementary symmetric functions are themselves a mapping that we can apply to symmetrize some polynomial.  \n"
