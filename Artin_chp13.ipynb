    "let $R$ be ring which is an integral domain that contains $\\mathbb F$ as a sub-ring and may be represented as an $n$ dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb F$.  (Note: this is an actual vector space over a field not an arbitrary module.)  Prove that $R$ is a field.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*remark*  \n",
    "This should remind us of ex 10.6.2 which was to prove that an integral domain with finitely many elements is a field.  Here we have an integral domain that may have infinitely many elements, but it is still finite in some 'nice' sense -- in particular it can be interpreted as a finite dimensional vector space.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*proof:*   \n",
    "The idea is to prove that every $r\\in R-\\big\\{0\\big\\}$ has an inverse  \n",

    "fix $r\\in R-\\big\\{0\\big\\}$ and selecting an arbitrary element in $v\\in R$, we have  \n",

    "$r\\cdot v = v'$   \n",

    "$r\\cdot\\big( \\alpha v\\big) =\\alpha \\cdot \\big(r\\cdot v\\big)$   \n",
    "\n",
    "so $r$ is a linear operator on this vector space $V$.  Since the domain is integral, we have  \n",

    "$\\dim\\ker\\big(r\\big) = 0$  \n",
    "and by rank nullity,  \n",
    "$\\dim\\text{im}\\big(r\\big) = n$  \n",
    "\n",
    "hence $r$ is both injective and surjective and thus invertible  \n",

    "$\\mathbf B:=\\bigg[\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} v_1 & v_2 &\\cdots & v_{d} \\end{array}\\bigg]$  \n",
    "we then model this forward and run it backward to solve for the inverse of arbitrary $r\\in R-\\big\\{0\\big\\}$  \n",

    "first:  \n",
    "For arbitrary $v\\in \\mathbb R$ which is a vector space $V$ over $\\mathbb F$  we have   \n",
    "$v = \\mathbf {Bx}$   and  \n",

    "since the basis uniquely characterizes all elements in the vector space, the problem reduces to the familiar  \n",

    "$A\\mathbf x = \\mathbf y$   \n",
    "and of course the answer is yes, because $A$ has a trivial kernel (by integrality of our ring and uniqueness of basis representation, we know $r\\cdot v = 0$ *iff* $v=0$ which is equivalent to $A\\mathbf x = \\mathbf 0$ *iff* $\\mathbf x =0$ ) \n",
    "\n",
    "so $A$ has non-zero determinant (which takes on a value in $\\mathbb F$ and hence is a unit)  and   \n",

    "hence we have found the multiplicative inverse of $r$ and $r$ is invertible.  But the choice of $r\\in R-\\big\\{0\\big\\}$ was arbitrary so all non-zero elements in $R$ are invertible and $R$ is a field.   \n",
