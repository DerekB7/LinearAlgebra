    "(a) One interpretation of this problem is that it allows an intersesting extension and linkage of the $GM \\leq AM$ inequality.  Note that since all eigenvalues and diagonal entries of $\\mathbf A$ are real valued and $\\geq 0$, it seems like we may be able to use $GM \\leq AM$  here. Not knowing the Hadamard Inequality, we could upper bound the determinant (to the $\\frac{1}{n}$ power) of $\\mathbf A$ --i.e. the product of the eigenvalues-- by the arithmetic mean of the eigenvalues which is also equal to the arithmetic mean of the diagonal elements of $\\mathbf A$ (i.e. $det\\big(\\mathbf A\\big)^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\leq \\ \\frac{1}{n}trace\\big(\\mathbf A\\big)$).  What the Hadamard Inequality allows us to do is bound the determinant (to the $\\frac{1}{n}$ power) of $\\mathbf A$ by the geometric mean of the diagonal elements of $\\mathbf A$.  Since $GM \\leq AM$, we know that this gives us a tigher bound.  I.e. It allows us to say \n",

    "$det\\big(\\mathbf A\\big)^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\leq \\big(\\prod_{k=1}^{n} a_{k,k}\\big)^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\leq \\frac{1}{n} \\big(\\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{k,k}\\big) = \\frac{1}{n}trace\\big(\\mathbf A\\big) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{k=1}^n \\lambda_k$\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Assume we have some square matrix $\\mathbf B$, where $\\mathbf B^H \\mathbf B := \\mathbf A$, what this inequality says, is that from a geometric perspective, if we look at the diagonal of $\\mathbf A$, we see the squared lengths of each respective column of $\\mathbf B$ in each diagonal entry of $\\mathbf A$.  The underlying geometry is that the squared magnitude of the determinant of $\\mathbf B$ --i.e. given by $det \\big(\\mathbf A\\big)$ -- cannot be any bigger than the product of squared lengths of each column of $\\mathbf B$ -- and we have equality **iff** each column of $\\mathbf B$ is orthogonal to each other --resulting in a diagonal matrix $\\mathbf A$ (or in the degenerate case where $\\mathbf B$ has at least one column of zeros and hence it doesn't have enough column vectors with positive length to even try to form a parallelepiped that matches its dimensions).\n",
