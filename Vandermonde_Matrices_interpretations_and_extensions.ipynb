    "The typical argument for linear indepdence is in fact a touch shorter than this and does not need Vandermonde matrices -- however it relies on a contradiction that is not particularly satisfying.  The following proof -- adapted from Winitzki's *Linear Algebra via Exterior Products* is direct -- and to your author-- very intuitive.  Note that I had long ago considered a similar approach, except rather than looking at the eigenectors over ${0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}$ iterations, I looked at what happens as the number of iterations tends to infinity.  This, however, no doubt introduced some heavier machinery than needed (including some subtletites from analysis that should have been addressed though perhaps weren't).  Furthermore, it was an effective way to consider the issue with respect to the magnitudes of the eigenvalues, but dealing with periodic behavior over equivalent magnitudes became rather difficult. \n",
