    "Quite often in basic machine learning applications -- say with linear regression -- we gather $n$ samples of data and look to fit a model to it.  Note: we often have *a lot* of data, and in fact n can be any natural number.  For illustrative purposes, we start with the case of n = 5. \n",

The core reasons are simple -- it is a special type of unitary (or orthogonal) matrx, it has a simple visual representation via graph theory, and its trace is extremely easy to compute.  On top of that there is a messier, related reason -- I was inspired by the n iterations cycle that is implied in the proof of linear independence of eigenvectors associated with unique eigenvalues which used a Vandermonde matrix, and I had recently used a connected graph 3 x 3 permutation matrix (and its eigenvalues) to explain to someone the that 3 complex numbers on the unit circle must be equidistant when there is a constraint they all sum to zero  -- I knew that first eigenvalue had to be one because the matrix is stochastic, I knew the trace was 0, and I knew that for a real valued matrix, complex eigenvalues numbers come in conjugate pairs and hence in the 3 x 3 case they had to be evenly spaced in the unit circle.  In many respects this posting grew out of my attempt to generalize ideas from that conversation, plus a growing interest I had in Vandermonde matrices and matrices used in convolutions. I chose to use permutation matrices associated with a connected graph for those reasons and was pleasantly surprised that I was able to derive the DFT and all of its properties in full, just using this permutation matrix and spectral theory, for an arbitrary $n$ x $n$ dimensional case.* \n",

    "There is an alternative proof which shows a slightly stronger claim using only Vandermonde Matrices after this one. Strictly speaking this claim only requires the traces to be equivalent for $k = \\{1, 2, 3, ..., \\big(max(m,n) + 1\\big)^2\\}$, i.e. the number of iterations is approximately the size of the bigger dimension, squared, whereas in the alternative proof, the number of iterations is required to be only approx twice the size of the bigger dimension (I.e. two full 'cycles').  Your author knows that with considerably more work the claim could be made while requiring only one cycle instead of two cycle, though the tighter claim requires considerably more machinery and may not be as intuitive.  Hence in a manner like teaching Kosaraju's algorithm instead of Tarjan's for Strongly Connected Components, the 2 cycle approach is emphasized as it is considerably more intuitive than the one cycle approach. It also offers some unique insights on the type of roots a polynomial has, and how many unique roots it has.  (Indeed it generalizes nicely to probability problems that have distributions that may not have a finite number of terms.)  That said, an illustrative sketch of the one cycle approach is given at the end of this posting, under the heading of \"Enter the Companion Matrix\", and then the underlying formula for recovering the characteristic polynomial via a full cycle is derived in two different ways under the sections at the very end with \"Newton's Indetities\" in their title.  All in all, we have 4 different proofs of the fact that a large enough number of traces uniquely characterizes the matrices eigenvalues (assuming they exist -- which is always the case if $\\mathbb C$ is your field.)\n",

    "\n",
    "One interpretation underpinning this is that there is a way to recreat a characteristic polynomial purely from traces of matrix powers -- so of course the trace of repeated matrix powers 'gives away' the eigenvalues.  An alternative interpretation comes in the analogy with the method of moments in probability -- if we have $E[X^k]$ for $k = \\{1, 2, 3, ...,\\}$, then the underlying probability distribution is uniquely specified.  Notice that $\\frac{1}{m} trace\\big(\\mathbf X^k\\big)$ is analogous to $E[X^k]$ (though there is the question as to whether we want to us the m total eigenvalues in $\\frac{1}{m}$, or perhaps instead just use $\\frac{1}{s}$ where $s:= n - z$, where we have z eigenvalues equal to zero.  In any case the analogoy with methods of moments is quite interesting.  \n",

    "This final bit of using Cayley Hamilton was a direct port from Dan Kalman's \"A Matrix Proof of Newton's Identities\".  Originally this posting was going to be a walkthrough of that writeup, however your author found the steps around the time of synthetic division (approx $\\frac{2}{3}$ the way through) to be hard to follow both symbollically, and intuitively.  However, the use of Cayley Hamilton to extinguish sums of terms that are outside \"on the fringe\" of the characteristic polynomial was a nice touch, and included here. *Update: A walkthrough of Kalman's proof of Newton Identities follows in 3 paragraphs*  \n",

    "The approach didn't explicitly cover the case of terms that could be 'beyond' the characteristic polynomial, but the layout of the problem seemed more intuitive than most discussions that I've seen.  This long-form writeup on Newton's Identities is an attempt to carefully work through those steps, and to do so in a way that is somewhat visual and intuitive.  That said, there is a considerable amount of symbol manipulation involved in deriving Newton's Identities.  Hence the 'visualization' associated with this really comes down to the earlier worked example of traces on the Companion matrix.  Further the exact recurrence shown in here is of interest to your author, but the Hankel matrix formed by two Vandermonde matrices (with a diagonal matrix containing algebraic multiplicities in between) -- i.e. for what turns out to be the \"Hamburger Moment Problem\", is in many ways still more intuitive.\n",

    "This synthetic division process is elementary and taught as part of basic algebra or single variable calculus.  However, it remains mechanically simple but for whatever reason, not quite intuitive to your author.  The major advantage of this approach is it does not require any notion of infinity, whether that means an infinite series, or the notion of a limit for a derivative.  The time where we recognize $p'(x)$ in two forms is merely for convenience (or alternatively, it is akin to formally differentiating, much like formally differentiating a power series where no underlying notions of limits are required).  Thus the above approach is complementary to one that needs convergence concepts from analysis.

    "*This is very interesting and has very useful applications in CS (or at least in theoretical CS).  At its core the idea is polynomials don't have that many zeros, even though otherfunction may have lots of them.  This statement is very clear and accurate in the single variable case.  It gets hard to make the statement meaningful, however, in the multivariable case as there are may be uncountably many zeros.  However, if we drew a picture of a twovariable (x,y) polynomial and shaded in the zeros, we would see that the area isn't that much.  One approach would be to specify probability distributions or measures.  However a much more slick approach is to, in effect, truncate our domain to be a finite set -- in particular a finite field-- which allows simple counting arguments and a uniform distribution.  On top of that the finite field has major benefits in terms of avoiding numeric stability issues, e.g. when we are trying to 'back door' a permanent calculation, like in looking for at least one perfect matching in a bipatite graph (ala Hall's marriage problem).
