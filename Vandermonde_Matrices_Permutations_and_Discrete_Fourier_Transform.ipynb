    "# Motivating Background: figuring out a function from data points\n",

    "Quite often in basic machine learning applications -- say with linear regression -- we gather $n$ samples of data and look to fit a model to it.  Note: we often have *a lot* of data, and in fact n can be any natural number.  For illustrative purposes, we start with the case of n = 5. \n",

Also note that in machine learning we may use notation like $\\mathbf {Xw} = \\mathbf y$, where we solve for the weights in $\\mathbf w$.

This will allow us to, in effect, reduce our problem to the n - 1 x n - 1 dimensional case.  \n",

    "Also recall that the determinant of $\\mathbf A^T$ is equivalent to the determinant of $\\mathbf A$. Thus the above procedure is equivalent to subtracting a scaled version of column 0 of the original $\\mathbf A$ from column 1, and a scaled version of column 1 in the original $\\mathbf A$ from column 2, and so on.

On top of that there is a messier, related reason -- I was inspired by the n iterations cycle that is implied in the proof of linear independence of eigenvectors associated with unique eigenvalues which used a Vandermonde matrix, and I had recently used a connected graph 3 x 3 permutation matrix (and its eigenvalues) to explain to someone the that 3 complex numbers on the unit circle must be equidistant when there is a constraint they all sum to zero  -- I knew that first eigenvalue had to be one because the matrix is stochastic, I knew the trace was 0, and I knew that for a real valued matrix, complex eigenvalues numbers come in conjugate pairs and hence in the 3 x 3 case they had to be evenly spaced in the unit circle.  In many respects this posting grew out of my attempt to generalize ideas from that conversation, plus a growing interest I had in Vandermonde matrices and matrices used in convolutions.

    "When using *(2)* with non-nilpotent matrices, in all cases we may find some matrix $\\mathbf Z$ that is not defective (i.e. even with repeated eigenvalues, we choose eigenvectors that form a basis), where $trace\\big(\\mathbf Z^k\\big) = trace\\big(\\mathbf X^k\\big)$ for $k =\\{1,2,3, ...\\}$, and as before $ trace\\big(\\mathbf X^k\\big) = trace\\big(\\mathbf Y^k\\big)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we can then call on the *easy* Cayley Hamilton proof that applies for a non-defective square matrix like $\\mathbf Z$, and use proof *(2)* to show that $\\mathbf X$ has the same non-zero eigenvalues, with the same multiplicities, as $\\mathbf Z$.  We can then repeat this process and see that $\\mathbf Y$ has the same non-zero eigenvalues, with the same multiplicities as $\\mathbf Z$.  Thus $\\mathbf X$ has the same non-zero eigenvalues, with the same multiplicities as $\\mathbf Y$.  \n",
