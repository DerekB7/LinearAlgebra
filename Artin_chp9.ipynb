    "*i.)* the $n\\times n$ permutation matrix group is generated by elementary type 2 matrices (i.e. an identity matrix except there is a single pairwise swap / basic transposition between some element i and some element j.  This was ex 1.4.2 and may be done e.g. by induction on $n$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*ii.)* all elementary type 2 matrices $\\in G_n$ are *conjugate* (i.e. permutation matrix similar).  If one draws the associated graphs with two distinct elementary type 2 matrices, it is immediate that there is a graph isomorphism between the two.  For a more granular proof, since conjugacy is an equivalence relation, it suffices to prove that an arbitrary type two matrix $E_{i,j}^{(2)}$ is conjugate to a particularly simple elementary type 2 matrix   \n",
    " $E_{1,2}^{(2)}=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 &1 & \\mathbf 0^T \\\\ 1 & 0  & \\mathbf 0^T \\\\ \\mathbf 0 & \\mathbf 0 &I_{n-2}\\end{bmatrix}$  \n",
    "\n",
    "so (where we may omit the transpose sign for notational conveniences since elementary type 2 matrices are symmetric)   \n",
    "$E_{2,j}^{(2)} E_{i,j}^{(2)}E_{2,j}^{(2)} = E_{i,2}^{(2)}$  and  \n",

    "$PE_{i,j}^{(2)}P^T = E_{1,2}^{(2)}$  \n",
    "so they are conjugate\n",
    "\n",
    "*iii.)* 1-dimensional representations are isomorphic to taking values in the underlying scalar field, hence elements in the image must commute.  This means every conjugacy class takes on the same value under the image of the candidate isomorphism.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*iv.)*  $\\big(E_{i,j}^{(2)}\\big)^2=I_n$ that is, elementary type 2 matrices are involutive, and as we exploited in ex 8.1.6 (ref: 'Artin_chp8.ipynb'), the property of being involutive is preserved under homomorphism.  That is we know   \n",

    "*v.)* This implies that it must be the case that $\\phi\\big(E_{i,j}^{(2)}\\big)= c\\in \\big\\{-1,+1\\big\\}$.  If $c=1$ for any type 2 elementary matrix, then by (ii) and (iii) all elementary type 2 matrices take on the value 1 under the homorphism, and since they generate the group, this results in the trivial representation.  The only other possibility then is $c=-1 = \\det\\big(E_{i,j}^{(2)}\\big)$ for all elementary type 2 matrices-- this is the sign representation. \n"

Both of these representations are isomorphic to the dihedral group-- but there is a linguistic issue as isomorphism means structure preserving, but we are not specifying what structure exactly.  The former amounts to using the standard 2-d representation and applying the inclusion map to embed in 3-d... it preserves pleasant algebraic properties like the determinant but does not conform to geometric interpretations in 3-d. On the other hand the latter ($D'$) representation preserves geometry while losing certain algebraic properties.  In each case we have an invertible homomorphism, so an isomorophism, but the issue common in this chapter is we rarely specify *what* exactly we want to be preserved by the isomorphism.
