    "\n",
    "*ii.)* all elementary type 2 matrices $\\in G_n$ are *conjugate* (i.e. permutation matrix similar).  If one draws the associated graphs with two distinct elementary type 2 matrices, it is immediate that there is a graph isomorphism between the two.  For a more granular proof, since conjugacy is an equivalence relation, it suffices to prove that an arbitrary type two matrix $E_{i,j}^{(2)}$ is conjugate to a particularly simple elementary type 2 matrix   \n",

    "$E_{2,j}^{(2)} E_{i,j}^{(2)}E_{2,j}^{(2)} = E_{i,2}^{(2)}$  and  \n",

    "$PE_{i,j}^{(2)}P^T = E_{1,2}^{(2)}$  \n",
    "so they are conjugate\n",
    "\n",
    "*iii.)* 1-dimensional representations are isomorphic to taking values in the underlying scalar field, hence elements in the image must commute.  This means every conjugacy class takes on the same value under the image of the candidate isomorphism.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*iv.)*  $\\big(E_{i,j}^{(2)}\\big)^2=I_n$ that is, elementary type 2 matrices are involutive, and as we exploited in ex 8.1.6 (ref: 'Artin_chp8.ipynb'), the property of being involutive is preserved under homomorphism.  That is we know   \n",

    "*v.)* This implies that it must be the case that $\\phi\\big(E_{i,j}^{(2)}\\big)= c\\in \\big\\{-1,+1\\big\\}$.  If $c=1$ for any type 2 elementary matrix, then by (ii) and (iii) all elementary type 2 matrices take on the value 1 under the homorphism, and since they generate the group, this results in the trivial representation.  The only other possibility then is $c=-1 = \\det\\big(E_{i,j}^{(2)}\\big)$ for all elementary type 2 matrices-- this is the sign representation. \n"
