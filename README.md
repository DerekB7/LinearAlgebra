# LinearAlgebra
This folder contains my notes on various topics in Linear Algebra.  It is a mixture of my notes and actual thinking at the time I learned a topic, and some subsequent thoughts.  In many case I've discovered better, streamlined approaches to these results.  In some cases the notes have been updated to reflect this.  However, I've left in a lot of my original thoughts so that readers may perhaps discover the result by the method that I originally did -- and indeed this serves as a useful refresher for me as well if I am rusty on a topic.  

**Note:** All notebooks render properly locally.  Unfortunately GitHub does not render certain things correctly.  The two most common GitHub rendering errors are (i) Blocked Matrices and (ii) Markdown and TeX for very long notebooks (rendering errors start mid-way through the notebook).
